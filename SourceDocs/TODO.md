## 0.5 plan

done?

## "1.0" feeling 

Sandboxing
* Research, worth doing anything?  Even about `exit!` ?

Build
* Linux Travis

Stern GC review, especially non-Darwin

Refactor testcases

## "Post 1.0" feeling

Datatypes
* Ruby Rational + Complex wrappers

Concurrency
* Something cleverer?

Swift services to Ruby
* Tied gvars
* Swift implementations of global functions
  * 'next' thrown from Ruby proc called from Swift
* Swift implementations of classes
* GC protocol

SAFE and sandboxing

Crashiness
* Policy or something to avoid crashes in operators
